-TESTING SEARCHING FEATURE

There are already inserted in the employees list 3 employees(Arianna, Mario, Diego).
They have respectly the ids 345678, 123456, 789012.
For the test you can put in the form one of these ids, and you will see a form compiled with all the information about the employee with the chosen id.
If you put another id different from the ones listed above, you will see an empty form.
The form accepts every  type of data: in the requisites it is states that the type of id is integer, but there is no requisite saying that we must handle types error.
If you leave the form empty it will appear a page with the writing 'undefined form'.
